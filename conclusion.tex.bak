\chapter{Conclusions and outlook}
% Verbesserungsvorschlag, was muss getan werden um einen Demonstrator auszuliefern?
%\textit{A summary of the most important results, whereby a repeated emphasis of their relevance, importance and novelty cannot hurt. A brief precis of the envisaged future potential of the work is suitable here, but avoid addressing the Nobel Committee directly.}
The design and processing of a new \gls{ab:mmic} structure containing the Riemann Pump was beyond the scope of this thesis.\\
The calculation of the Riemann Code have to be done with an external signal processor, which has to compute this code in real time. 
This could be a problem, since the energy consumption could increase and the real time calculation.
%Nonetheless the number of signals which can be synthesized with this particular concept is increased with the possibility to change to another combination of slopes to approximate the signal.
%All this calculation should be done with a signal processor and an algorithm.
%With the variation of the slopes and the variation of the sampling time in theory it is possible to create every single signal with more or less good \gls{ab:sqnr}.
 In a more enhanced project a MATLAB algorithm would compute this code by minimizing the deviation between a theoretical signal and the synthesized signal.
