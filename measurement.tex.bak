\chapter{Measurement of the realized circuit in the time domain}
% The heart of the thesis, comprising a presentation of the functioning system and thus the culmination of the work. Important is an analysis of the results as well as a comparison with the state of the art. The reader should understand in this section why you should be awarded a MSc degree.

The aim of the measurement was to show the generation of different signals using the two bit resolution of the circuit.
The assembled hybrid test circuit was measured with respect to produce a decent signal waveform at its output, in the time domain.
The output voltage waveform was measured with a \SI{50}{\ohm} termination and a \SI{3.3}{\nano\farad} capacitance, respectively.
A discrete passive capacitor replaced the calculated impedance in chapter \ref{ch:design} used for the simulation.
In order to avoid damage (thermal breakdown) of the used chips the measurement was performed with low \gls{ab:dc} supply voltages.
Also the output capacitance was overdimensioned to ensure that the signal would not be clipped.
\\
After the calibration of the measurement instruments a stability check was performed to ensure that the test circuit do not oscillate.
%Otherwise the circuit (would oscillate and) could damage the chips.
In a next step the output of the circuit was measured with a resistive load to show the function of the push-pull stage.
For the input control voltage a \gls{ab:awg} from Keysight Technologies was used.
The correct functioning of the push-pull stage enabled the measurement with a capacitive load to synthesize a triangular waveform.


\section{Measurement setup}
An overview of the measurement setup is given in figure \ref{fig:SchematicMeasSetup}.
To ensure the instruments to work properly without taking damage their specifications have to be complied.
%In order to get good measurement results some requirements have to be fulfilled.

%In order to comply specification of the measurement instruments and avoid them to be damaged, it was necessary to fulfil some conditions.

The \gls{ab:awg} is needed to provide a digital signal which control the input of the circuit.
This signal is amplified by a pre power amplifier to get a decent voltage swing of \SI{5}{\volt}.
This swing is needed to be sure to turn the \gls{ab:gan} \gls{ab:hemt} at the input of the circuit on and off.
In addition to the swing another requirement is a \gls{ab:dc} offset of \SI{-10}{\volt}, because the transistor is a normally on device.
The \gls{ab:dc} bias is fed through a bias tee to ensure that the output of the \gls{ab:awg} is not loaded.\\
A power supply provides the \gls{ab:dc} supply bias for the \gls{ab:dut}.
In fact that maximum input signal of the oscilloscope is at \SI{2}{\volt}, the signal provided by the circuit has to be attenuated.
For the first measurement of the push-pull stage an attenuator with \SI{20}{\decibel} attenuation was connected between the output of the \gls{ab:dut} and the input of the oscilloscope.
The measurement of the voltage across the load capacitance was made with another oscilloscope which provides a handy probe.
This probe allows to measure the voltage directly on the hybrid substrate (conduction) transmission line.
The key elements of the measurement setup in time domain are:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Signal generator (Keysight AWG)
	\item Pre power amplifier (SHF803P, SHF804TL)
	\item Bias tee (SHF121A, SHF121D)
	\item Power supplies
	\item DUT
	\item Attenuator (18B50W)
	\item Capacitive load (3n3F)
	\item Oscilloscope (DSA-86118A)
	
%	\item Keysight AWG - (1V := 0dB; 0.7V := -3dB)
%	\item Broadband (35kHz-40GHz) amplifier (17dB gain) (digital signal with clk 1GHz, 10 harmonics -> 10GHz)
%	\item Bias Tees (DC bias)
%	\item DC supply (driver network, power transistor)
%	\item DUT
%	\item LOAD - OUTPUT ???
\end{itemize}

\section{Calibration and stability check}
Before the first measurement the instruments have to be calibrated.
To control the broadband amplifier and bias tees in a proper way, it was necessary to calibrate them.
The first measurement after setting things up, was to check stability of the circuit.
Therefore the \gls{ab:dut} was supplied by its bias voltages and the current was checked if it stays constant.
In fact that the current was stabilized after the transient time, it suggests that the circuit is stable.
For this measurement the in- and output connectors were terminated with \SI{50}{\ohm} terminations.


\section{Time domain measurement of push-pull stage}
Having demonstrated the stability of the circuit, the next step was to show the function of the push-pull stage.
The demonstration of the proper functioning push-pull output stage was done with a synchronous input control signal.
The \gls{ab:dut} needs a differential input signal to work properly.\\
Figure \ref{fig:inputMeas} shows the output of the \gls{ab:awg} used for the input control of the device under test.
The light grey signal form represent one input stream while the darker grey signal the inverse one.
This signal represents a digital bit stream which is needed to control the circuit.
The data rate of the presented signal is 200 Mbps while the analog fundamental frequency is \SI{100}{\mega\hertz}.

\end{figure}

Using this input signal the circuit under test, with a \SI{50}{\ohm} termination, provides the output shown in figure \ref{fig:measRload100M}.

\end{figure}

The light green signal is the measured data while the dashed line describes the ideal behaviour.
In an ideal world there would be neither rising nor falling time and the signal would switch between logical one and zero.\\
This figure demonstrate the proper functioning of the presented output push-pull stage, as the signal switches between Vdd and GND.
In addition to this it is demonstrated that the switches are very fast since the rising and falling edges are very steep.
The frequency accords with the input signal shown in figure \ref{fig:inputMeas}.


\section{Time domain measurement of synthesized signal}
The proper functioning of the designed circuit led to verifying that both bits work together.
If both bits work concurrently, it is possible to synthesize a signal.
This proofs the concept and the chosen approach.
The two bit resolution restricts the output voltage waveform.\\
In Figure \ref{fig:measCload100M} two different signals are shown which could be synthesized. 
The frequency of the synthesized triangular signal is \SI{100}{\mega \hertz} while the voltage swing is \SI{1.8}{\volt} and \SI{0.8}{\volt} respectively.

\begin{figure}[htb!]
	\centering
  \includegraphics{100M_Cload_regression.pdf}
	\caption{time domain measurement with capacitive load}
	\label{fig:measCload100M}
\end{figure}

The red signal represents a synthesized triangular waveform with a slope corresponding to $3 i_0$, while the brown dashed signal provides the theoretical signal.\\
The blue signal represents a synthesized triangular waveform with a slope corresponding to $1 i_0$, while the dashed darker blue signal provides the theoretical one.\\
The same notation is valid for the synthesized signal in figure \ref{fig:measCload150M}.
Here the signal frequency is \SI{150}{\mega \hertz} which is the upper bound for this measurement setup.
The signal integrity is much worse going beyond this frequency.

\end{figure}

%Although the difference between the relative slope of $3 i_0$ and $1 i_0$ is much less the signal can 
The difference between the slopes is getting smaller while the signal quality is decreasing.


\section{Discussion of measurement results}
In a first step it was shown that the designed circuit converts a digital signal to an analog one.
The frequency limit for this measurement setup consisting of this designed circuit is at roughly \SI{150}{\mega \hertz}.
Heat is critical. 
Aside from some parasitic effects the proof of the concept was successful.

%\textit{is it possible to measure the heat spreading on the substrate?}
%Is the measurement result expected due to the simulation? Can the demonstrator be simulated although no model for this chips exists? The real simulation are not done due to the fact that no losses respected.
