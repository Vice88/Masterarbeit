\textbf{bandwidth limitation}
\textit{The lower bound is determined by the sampling time (inverse of the sampling frequency) and the smallest current achieved with the dimensioned transistors.
 The smallest achievable current times the smallest sampling time (highest sampling frequency) determine the smallest absolute slope achievable. \\

% \textbf{Is every signal possible to create? a rect signal has too steep flanks to create. The signal bandwidth ranges from DC to 6 GHz but what is the amplitude range? Is there a limitation regarding the amplitude?}
