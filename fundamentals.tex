\chapter{Fundamentals-Theory for this approach to reach 5G}
\textit{Presentation of the theoretical basis required for an understanding of your work. Do not begin with Newton's laws or Maxwell's equations: imagine that the reader is a competent engineering professor, but not necessarily in your field of expertise. Do not bother to discuss any theory that you do not employ in later sections.}
In the following some fundamentals are described shortly.
\section{Concept of Software-defined radio}
The concept of software-defined radio is adapted to deal with the old problems of mobile communication. The idea is to bring the digital domain as close as possible to the RFFE. The reason is digital filtering, data processing is more efficient, easier, less complex, has less cost, and so on. The main problem of this approach is the energy consumption based on an inefficient ADC/DAC. However the concept is very helpful for future designs of an digital front end. The Software-defined radio has the advantage, that it is adaptiv for future software changes. the hardware is still the same, only the firmware has to be upgraded. broad spectrum of signal can be received with this architecture. from nearly DC to 2 GHz. For future mobile communication standards, the frequency range has to deal with frequencies beyond 2 GHz up to 6 GHz. Nowadays IEEE802.11ac standard is located at 5GHz. Based on this concept a digital-analog converter is designed to deal with a higher bandwith than other devices nowadays. The DAC is used in the transmission path of the design.
%\section{An approach to reach the desired high speed for the digital-to-analog converter: The Riemann Pump}
\section{Idea of the Riemann Pump}
The Riemann Pump, named after the mathematician Riemann, who founded the Riemann Integral, is a special charge pump. A charge pump as the name suggests pumps electrons into a capacitve load. Across the load capacitance a voltage is created. By adjusting the switches for up or down the voltage can be adjusted, as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:ChargePump}.

\end{figure}

\begin{equation}
	V_{out} = \frac{1}{C_{out}}{ \int_0^T \! i_{out}(t) \, \mathrm{d}t} , \hspace{1cm} T = \frac{2*OSR}{f_{sample}}
\end{equation}

The Riemann Pump is a digital-to-analog converter based on the concept of a charge pump. A few charge pumps with different sized sources in parallel shows the concept of this fast digital to analog converter. With the ability to control the switches really fast, because of the use of GaN25 technology, which have a high transition frequency, a high bandwidth is reached.

 The working principle is to integrate a current into a capacitive load, this integration is based on Riemann Integral, where the name come from. This integration converts the current into a voltage. This output voltage can be applied to the input of a power amp and then to the antenna to propagate it. The current, which charges the capacitive input impedance of the power amp, is controlled by a digital code. A fixed set of slopes, represents the different current sources. A desired signal in the time-domain is generated with MatLab. This signal can consist of many different signals (different carriers and modulation types). This signal is sampled with the given set of slopes. The minimization of the error leads to the Riemann Code. With this Riemann Code (digital) the driver circuit is controlled. This leads to an analog signal formed by the digital input signal.

\end{figure}

With this information a high speed digital to analog converter is created. In the following the Riemann Integral is shown.

	\caption{Integral of the current which pumps charges on to the cap.}
	\label{fig:RiemannIntegral}
\end{figure}
This integral with its slopes as cited in \ref{fig:SlopesAndTable} generates the riemann code which controls the switches of the circuit. This is done by minimizing the error between the theoretical, desired signal and its synthesized one as shown in Fig. \ref{fig:RiemannIntegralError}

The signal to noise ratio is calculated in equation \ref{eq:SNR_RiemannPumpConversion}. Quantization noise model {reference: analog device}
\begin{equation}
	\text{SNR } [\si{\dB}] = 6.02N + 9.03r - 7.78 + 10\log_{10}(1 - \frac{1}{2}^{N-1} + \frac{1}{2}^{2N})
	\label{eq:SNR_RiemannPumpConversion}
\end{equation}
