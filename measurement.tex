\chapter{Measurement}
\section{Measurement setup}
This section will describe the setup of the measurements. The approach was to resort to past designs and works of a former employee of IAF. Based on the work of Stephan Maroldt, i took some MMICs and Chips to get a first realisation of the work.
\section{Measurement results}
is the measurement result as expected from the simulation?
