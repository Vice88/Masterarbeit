\chapter{Measurement}
\section{Measurement setup}
This section will describe the setup of the measurements. The approach was to resort to past designs and works of a former employee of IAF. Based on the work of Stephan Maroldt, i took some MMICs and Chips to get a first realisation of the work.
\begin{itemize}
	\item Keysight AWG - 1Vpp
	\item Broadband (35k-40GHz) amplifier (5Vpp out) (digital signal with clk 1GHz, 10 harmonics -> 10GHz)
	\item Bias Tee (DC bias)
	\item DC supply (driver network, power transistor)
	\item DUT (2x X6 + 2x Y6 Chip + filter network)
	\item LOAD - OUTPUT
\end{itemize}
Output measurement maybe with anteverta active load pull system. 
\section{Measurement results}
how to measure at the output of the schematic? is the measurement result as expected from the simulation?
