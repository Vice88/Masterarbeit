Three different signals should be synthesized using the digital-to-analog converter named Riemann Pump. This signals were generated with a resolution of 3-bit. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item sine wave
	\item half sine wave
	\item triangular wave
\end{enumerate}
All signals are generated using a oversampling ratio of four, $OSR = 2^{r} = 4$. Hence the factor $r = 2$ which is used in the diagrams provided by the french mathematics. The digital control sequence is based on the weights of the slopes and the riemann code i
