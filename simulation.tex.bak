\chapter{Simulation}
Output measurement with harmonic balance simulator in agilent design system in time domain for different frequencies (control or signal bw?), e.g. 1 GHz.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item three-bit resolution, osr = 4, bw (theoretical signal)
	\item two-bit resolution, osr = 4, keep it small and simple, frequency higher
	\item assembly, low complexity, 
\end{enumerate}
Saturated current is determined by the push-pull transistor geometry, here: 532 mA. Voltage across capacitor is determined by the \begin{equation}
U = current * time * \frac{1}{capacitance}
\end{equation}

Harmonic Balance simulation is used to neglect the transient time (steady-state).\\ S-parameter simulation is done for the matching.\\ Stability simulation is done to check whether or not oscillation occurs. \\ In the last step the energy consumption is determined by the HB simulation\\

Three different signals are simulated using this digital-to-analog converter. These signals were generated with a resolution of 3-bit a oversampling ratio of four and the generated signal bandwidth is depending on the control frequency, here is the signal bandwidth 1 GHz. 
\begin{enumerate}
	\item sine wave
	\item half sine wave
	\item triangular wave
\end{enumerate}
All signals are generated using a oversampling ratio of four, $OSR = 2^{r} = 4$. Hence the factor $r = 2$ which is used in the diagrams provided by the french mathematics. The digital control sequence is based on the weights of the slopes and the riemann code is generated by hand. Therefore no matlab script exists which calculates the optimal code, minimizing the error, for controlling the digital to analog converter. 

%% Important: appearance(format) all the same, same frequency, sam oversamplingratio, same resolution, et cetera
