\chapter{Approach-Circuit design}
Based on the idea a digital to analog converter is designed. Hence it is for the transmitting path and also the energy consumption suggest that it would be in a base station. So the deisgned device should be integrated in a base station transmitter path.
Approach of the push-pull stage Maksimovic, Maroldt.\\
Approach of theoretical and synthesized signal -> MatLab generation of Riemanncode, SNR.\\ Stability, driver concept, energy consumption, frequency bandwidth, gain
