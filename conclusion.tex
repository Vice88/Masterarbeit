\chapter{Conclusions and outlook}
\textit{A summary of the most important results, whereby a repeated emphasis of their relevance, importance and novelty cannot hurt. A brief precis of the envisaged future potential of the work is suitable here, but avoid addressing the Nobel Committee directly.}
The calculation of the Riemann Code have to be done with an external signal processor, which has to compute this code in real time. 
This could be a problem, since the energy consumption could increase and the real time calculation.
