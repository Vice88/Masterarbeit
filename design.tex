\chapter{Riemann Pump Circuit design - Implementation of the Riemann Pump approach}
In fact of the high energy consumption, the realized DAC is designed for the integration in a base station. Because it converts a digital bit sequence into an analog rf signal it is implemented in the transmitting path. Based on the idea of a push-pull stage the load impedance of the charge pump is designed first.
\section{Implementation of the Riemann Pump}
The concept of the Riemann Pump as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:RiemannPumpConcept} is realised with the design tool ADS.

\end{figure}

The first approach of designing a Riemann Pump was with a concept of a Push-Pull stage. This push-pull stage should charge a capacitive load at the output, which is the same as a normal charge pump. Push-pull stages complementary switch a high- and lowside transistor as in a charge pump. This was one possible approach. Concept of Maksimovic. 
\section{Calculation of the load impedance}
Based on the idea to design  a DAC for the transmitting path of a base station, a pre-power amplifier is taken to calculate the load impedance. The first assumption is that the load is a pre-power amplifier which generate a power of \SI{20}{\watt}. To generate this power, the gate periphery of a GaN25 HEMT has to be \SI{4}{\milli \metre} based on the approximation(- official reference???) \SI[per-mode=fraction]{5}{\watt\per\milli\metre}. To get this gate periphery four transistor in parallel each with 8 finger and \SI{125}{\micro \metre} are designed for the power amplifier. The bias point is determined with the MAG. Therefore the following load impedance could be determined.
\begin{equation}
Z = R - jX_c
\end{equation}

In the smith chart Fig. \ref{fig:smith_load_impedance} it is shown that the input impedance of the load is capacitive. The real part of the impedance is roughly $R = \SI{1.89}{\ohm}$, while the imaginary part is capacitive. An important point is the input capacitance is increasing with frequency. While it is normal that the imaginary part of the impedance is increasing with frequency, the input capacitance is not.

\end{figure}

The input capacitance is calculated through the impedance with:
\begin{equation}
imag[Z_{in}] = X_c
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
imag[Z_{in}] = \frac{1}{\omega C}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
imag[Z_{in}] = \frac{1}{2 \pi f C}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
C = \frac{1}{2 \pi f imag[Z_{in}]}
\end{equation}

\section{challenges to review - problems}
Same realisation problems, difficulties: Problem of BANDWIDTH, Vpp of control signal (5V pp for GaN transistors), high side driver, no complementary transistors available in III-V technology, low loss driver, high speed driver, digital control driver, too high energy consumption (stability???)
